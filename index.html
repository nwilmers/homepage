<span id="pubabs_mmac" style="display:none;">: 
This paper argues that changes in human activity during the COVID-19 pandemic led to an unusual divergence between crime rates and victimization risk in US cities. Most violent crimes declined during the pandemic. But analysis using foot traffic data shows that the risk of street crime victimization was elevated throughout 2020. People in public spaces were 15-30 percent more likely to be robbed or assaulted. This increase is unlikely to be explained by changes in crime reporting or selection into outdoor activities by potential victims. Traditional crime rates may present a misleading view of recent changes in public safety.

Using new establishment-by-occupation microdata, we show that the use of discretionary wage-setting significantly expanded in the 1970s and 1980s. Increasingly, wages for blue-collar workers were not standardized by job title or seniority, but instead subject to managerial discretion.  When establishments abandoned standardized pay rates, wages fell, particularly for the lowest-paid workers in a job and for those in establishments that previously paid above market rates.  This shift away from standardized pay rates, in context of a broader decline in worker bargaining power, accelerated the decline in real wages experienced by blue collar workers in the 1980s.

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(3)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_3"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_3" style="display:none;">: What is the relationship between the language people use to describe an event and their moral judgments?
We test the hypothesis that moral judgment and causative verbs rely on the same underlying mental
model of people’s actions. Experiment 1a finds that participants choose different verbs to describe the
major variants of a moral dilemma, the trolley problem, mirroring differences in their wrongness
judgments: they described direct harm with a single causative verb (Adam killed the man), and indirect
harm with an intransitive verb in a periphrastic construction (Adam caused the man to die). Experiments
1b and 2 separate physical causality from moral valuation by varying whether the victim is a person or
animal and whether the harmful action rescues people or inanimate objects. The results show that
people’s moral judgments lead them to portray a causal event as either more or less direct and intended,
which in turn shapes their verb choices. Experiment 3 finds the same basic asymmetry in verb usage in
a production task in which participants freely described what happened

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences</em>, 2014</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(4)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_4"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_4" style="display:none;">: Previous research emphasizes people’s dispositions as a source of differences
in moral views. We investigate another source of moral disagreement,
self-interest. In three experiments, participants played a simple economic
game in which one player divides money with a partner according to the
principle of equality (same payoffs) or the principle of equity (payoffs
proportional to effort expended). We find, first, that people’s moral judgment
of an allocation rule depends on their role in the game. People not only prefer
the rule that most benefits them but also judge it to be more fair and moral.
Second, we find that participants’ views about equality and equity change
in a matter of minutes as they learn where their interests lie. Finally, we find
limits to self-interest: when the justification for equity is removed, participants
no longer show strategic advocacy of the unequal division. We discuss
implications for understanding oral debate and disagreement.

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;">(with Michael Gurven, Christopher von Rueden, Hillard Kaplan, and Marino Lero Vie)</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em>, 2013</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle('big5')">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_big5"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_big5" style="display:none;">: The five-factor model (FFM) of personality variation has been replicated across a range of human
societies, suggesting the FFM is a human universal. However, most studies of the FFM have been
restricted to literate, urban populations, which are uncharacteristic of the majority of human evolutionary
history. We present the first test of the FFM in a largely illiterate, indigenous society. Tsimane
forager– horticulturalist men and women of Bolivia (n  632) completed a translation of the 44-item Big
Five Inventory (Benet-Martínez & John, 1998), a widely used metric of the FFM. We failed to find robust
support for the FFM, based on tests of (a) internal consistency of items expected to segregate into the Big
Five factors, (b) response stability of the Big Five, (c) external validity of the Big Five with respect to
observed behavior, (d) factor structure according to exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, and (e)
similarity with a U.S. target structure based on Procrustes rotation analysis. Replication of the FFM was
not improved in a separate sample of Tsimane adults (n  430), who evaluated their spouses on the Big
Five Inventory. Removal of reverse-scored items that may have elicited response biases produced factors
suggestive of Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness, but fit to the FFM remained poor.
Response styles may covary with exposure to education, but we found no better fit to the FFM among
Tsimane who speak Spanish or have attended school. We argue that Tsimane personality variation
displays 2 principal factors that may reflect socioecological characteristics common to small-scale
societies. We offer evolutionary perspectives on why the structure of personality variation may not be
invariant across human societies.
